# FedGNN-GAN-for-Drug-Discovery
Design of a framework that combines federated learning on graph neural networks with the incorporation of generative adversarial models to differentiate real molecules within the dataset from generated molecules which are evaluated using various drug molecule evaluation metrics (validity, uniqueness, diversity, etc).
