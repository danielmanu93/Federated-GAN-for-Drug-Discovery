# FL-DISCO - Federated generative framework for molecular Drug-Discovery
Design of a generative framework that integrates federated learning into generative adversarial models to generate highly novel and valid molecular samples which are evaluated using various drug evaluation metrics such as validity, uniqueness, diversity, novelty, Drug-likeliness and LogP scores.
